## Moving balls

You can see the app in action here: [movingBalls](https://fab-log.github.io/movingBalls.html)

The app shows three balls slowly floating through a visually defined section. Each ball is animated with changing colors, 3D effects, and a colored shadow. No installation is required. Opening the link above will run the app automatically in any browser.

Moving balls is a fun project grown from an exercise. It can serve for distraction, calming down or as a screen saver. In case you have any questions or remarks on the project, feel free to leave a comment here.

For the time being there are no further improvements planned. Yet, in the future possible features could be additional animations, such as touching effects or user controls for the number of balls and further settings.

Feel free to share, download or reuse the code without any restrictions.
